# Word-Guess-Game
Homework-3 

This is a hangman word game that has the users guess a particular word, here the title of a Marvel movie. 
The user has the ability to make 8 mistkaes before they lose. To get started a user just needs to click any alpha character
( no numbers or symbols) to start guessing. Wins are logged and the game resets either when the user wins or loses and the wins 
are recorded. 

This is a project maintained and contributed soley by Aaron Kelley.
